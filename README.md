# CPT304 Assignment 1: Analyzing “No Silver Bullet” and Design Patterns

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the fundamental challenges of software engineering as outlined in Fred Brooks' influential article “No Silver Bullet” and explore how the Decorator and Observer design patterns can effectively address these challenges. The report delves into the inherent difficulties in software development, such as complexity, conformity, changeability, and invisibility, and demonstrates how these design patterns can improve software productivity, maintainability, and quality.

## File Structure
- **report.pdf**: The final report document, analyzing the challenges of software engineering and the application of design patterns.
- **report.tex**: The LaTeX source code for generating the report.pdf.
- **drafts**: draft files from each team member.
